    <h1>National Forest Plan of 2018</h1>
    <div class="deadline">Deadline: 14th April 2018</div>
    <p>Currently our forests are of low quality and hence, low output. Therefore, they should be managed in a way that there be continuous output of forest products without too much damage. Additionally, the forests should be in the hands of the local communities. <br/><br/>Basically, the plan is proposing better yield and hence profits while causing least damage to our forests.</p>

  <div id='elaboration'>
    <h2>Elaboration</h2>
    <p>The plan starts by saying that previous plans made in 1894 and 1952 focussed on making money using the forests and because the latest plan made in 1988 focussed on protecting our forests, it has led to an increase  in the size of our forests.
      While the plan talks about preserving the forest, it contradicts itself and says that our forests should be used more and have a higher output. The plan says our forests will be managed to ensure that they provide products, purify the air and water quality and provide recreation, but it doesn’t say how this will happen. It says it will manage the sale of forest produce - other than wood, to make these products more profitable for people living in the forest, it will also provide gas connections to people living in the forest, so that they don’t need to use wood.
