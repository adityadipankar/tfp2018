    <h1>National Forest Plan of 2018</h1>
    <div class="deadline">Deadline for responses: 14th April 2018 • <span class='emphasis'>16 Days to go</span></div>

    <p class="summary">In a nutshell, the plan says that currently our forests are of low quality and hence, low output. Therefore, they should be managed in a way that there be continuous output of forest products without too much damage. Additionally, the forests should be in the hands of the local communities. <br/><br/>Basically, the plan is proposing better yield and hence profits while causing least damage to our forests.</p>
    <div id='full-analysis'>Read & Respond</div>
  </div>
  <div id='elaboration'>
    <h2 class="title top-border">The Goals</h2>
    <p>The plan says it’s goals are to:
    <ol>
      <li>Have 1/3rd of India’s total land as forests</li>
      <li>Have 2/3rd of India’s mountain lands as forests to reduce soil erosion.</li>
      <li>It aims to increase protected areas (take a look at what a protected area is in the resources)</li>
      <li>Not allow people to use forests for any other purpose</li>
      <li>Plant more trees in cities and along farms</li>
      <li>Use forest land to improve the quality of water</li>
      <li>Manage our forests better to reduce emissions and meet India’s targets<span class='mandatory'>*</span></li>
      <li>Use our forests without causing too much damage</li>
      <li>Set guidelines that monitor and check our progress on these goals</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="title top-border">Foundation Of The Plan</h2>
    <p>While the plan talks about preserving the forest, it contradicts itself and says that our forests should be used more and have a higher output. Here are some of the foundations the plan is based on:
      <ol>
        <li>The plan says our forests will be managed to ensure that they provide products, purify the air and water quality and provide recreation, but it doesn’t say how this will happen.</li>
        <li>It says it will manage the sale of forest produce - other than wood, to make these products more profitable for people living in the forest.</li>
        <li>It will provide gas connections to people living in the forest, so that they don’t need to use wood.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2 class='title top-border'>The Overall Plan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Plant trees that make profits, like timber in the forests and on land that is not productive because of human damage</li>
        <li>Partner with private companies to plant these trees and run campaigns like “wood is good” and “grow more wood - use more wood”, while reducing the rules that stop companies from cutting trees.</li>
        <li>Reduce natural and manmade threats to the forest by using technology, and survey all our plants and animals in the forests.</li>
        <li>Launch a National Community Forest Management programme at a village level and get increased funds.</li>
        <li>Create institutes to research and study the forests.</li>
        <li>Study clashes between humans and animals to understand how it can stop such clashes and control strictly the trade of wild animals.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    *India is a part of a few international agreements to reduce climate change, the forest policy says we will manage our forests better to reduce emissions and meet India’s targets.</p>
